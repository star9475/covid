#### 2016 Seattle Mariners Visualization 

This Shiny App is for visualizing the Covid outbeak in the United States.  The data is courtesy the Covid Project at  <https://covidtracker.com>.  There are state views and country views.

The units that can be selected to be plotted come from the data that is tracked by covidtracker.com.  

I added "percent_pos" - this is the percent of tests that are positive and a good indicator of progress.

The facet plot can take a lot of time to load.  Be patient.
